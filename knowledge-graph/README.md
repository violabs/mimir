Current plan is to just do Neo4j but I can consider other options.

## Neo4j 

### Debug

Download the community edition for the visualization of the data. https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/#community

navigate to the project `bin` folder and run the following.

```shell
./neo4j-admin server console
```

Use the admin and password assigned to the docker container and you should be able to see any quotes added to
it.
